        <p className="nyt-page__text">
          During a week-long industry project at BrainStation, I collaborated
          with a team of UX designers and data scientists to develop a feature
          called Daily Bites.
        </p>
        <p className="nyt-page__text">
          The project's objective was to address the challenge: "How might we
          increase subscribers' awareness of and deepen engagement with The New
          York Times' products â€” Cooking, Games, Audio, Wirecutter, and The
          Athletic?".
        </p>
        <p className="nyt-page__text">
          Our solution was recognized for its strong alignment with the brand
          and significant potential to deepen user involvement.
